                Once upon a time, there was a little bird who couldn't fly. The little bird flapped and flapped her wings, yet she still could not experience the freedom and joy of flying as many of her hatch-mates could. The little bird was sad, and was scared that she would never be able to fly as so many of the other birds around her, and even wished that she were a lioness instead so that she did not have to fly. Oh how sad it was for a bird to wish to be a lion! Fortunately, this is not where the story ends for this poor little bird!

                She was about to give up at the end of one day, when she was pushed from a high cliff, flapped as fast as she could, and still could not manage to fly to stop herself from falling. She hit the ground very hard, and it hurt! She hurt one of her wings, and she could not flap for a few days. One morning, around 5 days later, she awoke feeling that her wing had healed. Not only had her wing healed, but she felt that both of her wings were much stronger! Some part of her wanted to try flying one more time. She spread her wings, lept off the same cliff she had fallen from several days earlier, and lo-and-behold - she was flying! It was going to take some getting used to, but she had finally done it! She also noticed that she was faster than a lot of the other birds who learned to fly before her! Oh how happy she was!
